How did you approach enhancing device efficacy and safety, and what were the key challenges you faced?\n\nThis will allow you to showcase your technical knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and the strategies you employed to tackle a complex engineering challenge. I'm interested in hearing the details of your research process, the methodologies you used, as well as how you identified and overcame any obstacles along the way. Please feel free to provide a comprehensive overview."

Can you share an example of a leadership role or volunteer experience that has contributed to your personal and professional growth, and how you might apply those learnings in a future role?\n\nThis allows you to demonstrate your ability to learn from experiences outside of just technical roles. I'm interested in understanding how you've developed important soft skills like leadership, teamwork, communication etc. through extracurricular involvement. An insightful response highlighting specific skills gained and how they translate to the workplace would be ideal. Please feel free to provide an example you feel best illustrates your growth mindset."
