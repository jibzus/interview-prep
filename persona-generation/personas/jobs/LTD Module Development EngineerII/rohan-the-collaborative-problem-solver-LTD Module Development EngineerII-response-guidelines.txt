- Demonstrates structured problem-solving approach using critical thinking and analysis
- Highlights key insights gained and measurable impact of the solution

Okay Response Criteria:
- Describes a somewhat relevant engineering problem with moderate complexity 
- Shows some evidence of critical thinking and analysis in problem-solving
- Mentions outcomes of the solution without quantifiable details

Poor Response Criteria:
- Discusses an overly simplistic or irrelevant engineering problem
- Lacks clear evidence of critical thinking or analytical problem-solving skills
- Fails to address the results or impact of the proposed solution

Question 2: How do you foster an inclusive, constructive, and productive work environment when collaborating with diverse teams and cultures?

Good Response Criteria:
- Provides concrete examples of promoting inclusivity and valuing diverse perspectives
- Demonstrates active listening, empathy and adaptability to work with different cultures
- Emphasizes constructive communication and creating psychological safety for all

Okay Response Criteria: 
- Discusses diversity and inclusion at a high level without specific examples
- Shows some understanding of cultural differences and need for adaptability
- Mentions importance of positive team dynamics without elaborating on "how"

Poor Response Criteria:
- Fails to recognize the value of diversity and inclusion in collaborative work
- Lacks cultural sensitivity or adaptability to work with different backgrounds
- Ignores aspects of fostering a constructive and psychologically safe team climate

Question 3: What experience do you have working in a manufacturing environment, and how have you applied engineering principles and theory in that context?

Good Response Criteria:
- Details relevant experience working in a manufacturing setting, ideally semiconductors
- Shares examples of applying specific engineering principles to solve manufacturing issues
- Connects manufacturing work with broader business goals and product quality

Okay Response Criteria:
- Has some exposure to manufacturing environments, but not directly in engineering role
- Provides high-level examples of using engineering mindset in manufacturing
- Shows basic understanding of the link between manufacturing and business objectives

Poor Response Criteria:
- Lacks any hands-on experience or exposure to real-world manufacturing 
- Struggles to cite instances of applying engineering principles in manufacturing context
- Fails to recognize the connection between manufacturing processes and end products

Question 4: Can you provide an example of a time when you had to quickly learn a new skill or technology to complete a project, and how did you approach that learning process?

Good Response Criteria:
- Offers a compelling example of rapidly acquiring a new skill or technology for a project
- Outlines a proactive, self-directed learning approach using multiple modalities
- Emphasizes ability to apply the newly learned skill to achieve project success

Okay Response Criteria:
- Shares an example of learning something new, but not under tight project timelines
- Shows some initiative in learning process, but heavily relies on formal training
- Discusses applying the new skill/technology, but without clear tie to project outcomes

Poor Response Criteria: 
- Cannot provide a concrete example of learning a new skill or technology for a project
- Takes a passive approach to learning, expecting others to spoon-feed information
- Fails to mention applying the newly acquired skill/knowledge to project completion
